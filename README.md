# Taiko Sniper 太鼓の狙撃 - Discord Bot
太鼓（たいこ）の　狙撃（そげき）  
Taiko meaning drum, sogeki meaning sniping.  
## 🎯 About
Some context: Within my Taiko group, we have a tradition of taking pictures _(sniping)_ of other members without their knowledge whenever we see them in public _(don't worry, we all consent to this)_. Thus, I am building a Discord bot that allows members to snipe each other while having their statistics tracked!  
## 📸 Preview
