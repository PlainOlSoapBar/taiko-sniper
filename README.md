# 太鼓の狙撃 - Taiko Sniper Discord Bot
太鼓（たいこ）の　狙撃（そげき）  
Taiko meaning drum, sogeki meaning sniping.  
## 🎯 About
Some context: Within my Taiko group, we have a tradition of taking pictures _(sniping)_ of other members without their knowledge whenever we see them in public _(don't worry, we all consent to this)_. Thus, I am building a Discord bot that allows members to snipe each other while having their statistics tracked!  
## 🔧 Features / Previews
### Snipe
- Command: `/snipe [user] [image]`

![Sniped Message](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d18865db-65e2-4c31-af76-00e7eb4a35a2)
## 📝 Plans
- /help command.
- Statistics tracking (# of snipes, # of sniped) + database.
  - Leaderboard (maybe with charts / diagrams).
  - Fun statistics such as who snipes the most and who gets sniped the most.
- Optional parameter for type of snipe (e.g. backshot--literally right behind them).
- Customizable(?) rules.
- Option to opt out.
- Shared data across different Taiko servers?
